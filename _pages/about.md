Hello, I am Che-Yen Chang, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Information Engineering at Chang Gung University. I am a lively and outgoing individual, always eager to learn.

During my high school years, I served as the vice president of a service-oriented club and as the vice coordinator for orientation events.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in various extracurricular activities such as department clubs, friendship associations, baking clubs, and community service teams.

In my first year of graduate studies, I served as a TA for Operating Systems and Operating Systems Practices, and successfully obtained the Graduate Student Cultivation Scholarship for two academic years.

Through these roles in various activities, I learned the importance of expressing my ideas clearly, communicating effectively with others, respecting diverse opinions, and mastering task prioritization, resource allocation, and time management.
