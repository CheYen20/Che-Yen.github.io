Hi, I'm Che-Yen (哲嚴), currently pursuing my Master's degree in Information Engineering at Chang Gung University. I am a lively and outgoing individual with a strong eagerness to learn and grow.

During my high school years, I served as the Vice President of a service-oriented club and as the Vice Coordinator for orientation events. Later, in my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in various extracurricular activities, including department clubs, friendship associations, baking clubs, and community service teams.

In my first year of graduate school, I served as a Teaching Assistant for Operating Systems and Operating Systems Practices. I was also honored to receive the Graduate Student Cultivation Scholarship for two consecutive academic years.

Through these roles and experiences, I have learned the importance of clear communication, respecting diverse perspectives, and effective teamwork. I have also strengthened my abilities in task prioritization, resource allocation, and time management.


Personality
======
I am enthusiastic about helping others and take pride in completing tasks responsibly. I prioritize my work according to urgency and strongly believe that punctuality is not only a key value but also a fundamental form of respect.


Hobbies
======
In my leisure time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of podcasts, which broaden my knowledge and perspectives. To maintain a balanced lifestyle, I also jog two to three times a week for both fitness and relaxation.
